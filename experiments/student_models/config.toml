# This example trains a single expert and generates poisoned labels
# for the sinusoidal (1xs) trigger with ResNet-32s. The labels are 
# FLIPped at the provided budgets. The config file is broken down 
# into three modules detailed in the schemas/ folder.

# Module to train and record an expert trajectory.
